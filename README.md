**Airbus_fuel_leak_detection**

Hello dear reader! This repository contains our work on fuel leak detection for our capstone project of our master in Big Data and Business Analytics. 

Our team was composed of Pierre Bléthon, Alexi Mathay, Diego Garate, Alice Seynaeve and Timothé Rigaudeau.

Here you will find:
- our code for cleaning and preprocessing of data + our unsupervised and statistical approaches
- our code for the anomaly detection with autoencoders (recommended to use google collab to open it)
- our final project report

Unfortunately given the big data nature of the project it was not possible to upload the datasets since they were significantly large, if you are interested please contact us.

We hope that you will appreciate our work, any feedback is welcome!

Thank you :)
